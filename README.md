# Simple Project Api
A Simple NodeJS Mongo DB projects scaffolding or API with REST end points.

#Why?

I wanted a simple starting point for API's and apps.

This project gives you the bare basics to get a new NodeJS, Express and MongoDB project off the ground fast. If you just need a simple API then this gives you all the basic end points you need to get going. If you want to build an app with a front end on top of this just add more routes and a template engine and off you go.
